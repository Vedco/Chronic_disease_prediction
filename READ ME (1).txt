READ ME --

There are three folders in the zip file, Code Files - contains all the code files for the project, Datasets - contains all the dataset files for the diseases and Deploy - contains all the files required for the deployment.

There are total four code files in the folder.

RUNNING THE CODE FILES --

(Use Google Colab)
(While entering the values for prediction it is recommended to enter valid values as given in the dataset or else the prediction might not be accurate.)

1. Chronic_Disease_Prediction.ipynb is the main code file for the project.
2. uplaod all three datasets and the main code file on the google colab notebook.
3. Run the codes one by one to predict the diseases.
4. To see how we understand and studied the dataset upload the rest three files from the Code Files folder on the same google colab notebook.
5. Run those codes to see the accuracies, correlation matrix, histograms and bar plots for each dataset.


COMING TO THE DEPLOYMENT --

For better user understanding we have also made the heart disease prediction form deployment where user can enter the values to predict the heart disease.
(using html, css and javascript)

To run this --

1. Open the Deploy folder in vscode or use 'cd Deploy' to get in the Deploy folder.
2. Before running the deployment make sure you are in the right folder and have 'flask app' installed, if not use 'pip install flask'.
3. Now to run open terminal and type 'python app.py' and press enter.
4. The form will be deployed, "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000" - this will be shown.
5. Copy the link and paste it in the browser and enter. The form will be displayed ready to predict the heart disease.

Enter the inputs to predict.
(make sure you have all the files in the Deploy folder)
